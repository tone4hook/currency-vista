        Sharing Pinia State Values and Actions!

        Unlock the power of Module Federation to effortlessly share and
        synchronize Pinia store actions and state values across your modules.
        Each module operates as an
        <span class="fs-4">independent instance</span>, ensuring no confusion or
        overlap in state management. Imagine the ease of making asynchronous
        calls to retrieve a list of available currencies for exchange rates from
        one module, and seamlessly displaying the state in another. All this is
        achieved while preserving a unified and efficient development
        environment. Experience the true potential of modules with Module
        Federation, where state sharing is not just about mirroring, but about
        active, <span class="fs-4">instance-specific</span> state management.
